There has been growing interest in the topic of maritime surveillance, specially due to the European migrant crisis. Frontex is an agency of the European Union that manages the cooperation between national border authorities securing Europeâ€™s external borders. The surveillance of large portions of sea usually requires high investments and Frontex struggles with lack of equipment and human resources to perform an acceptable surveillance task by the detection and tracking of vessels in oceanographic airborne images.
